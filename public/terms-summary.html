      <h1>Terms & Conditions — Plain Language Summary</h1>
      <p>Welcome — this page highlights the most important points so you can get started quickly. It is not the full legal text; a link to the full Terms follows each section.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>What is KSFP?</h3>
        <p>KSFP is a platform that helps parents and schools manage school fee payments and records. We provide interfaces for initiating payments, viewing receipts, and managing uploads.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>Payments</h3>
        <p>Payments can be made via supported providers (online) or by paying into a KCB Paybill for manual processing.</p>
        <div class="paybox">
          <strong>KCB Paybill:</strong> 522522 — <strong>Account:</strong> 0768331888
        </div>
        <p style="margin-top:8px">After you make a KCB Paybill payment, keep your receipt and follow the platform instructions to mark the invoice as paid or upload proof if requested by the school.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>Privacy & Data</h3>
        <p>We collect your name, phone number and email to authenticate you and send payment notifications. We store only what we need and do not sell your data.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>Your responsibilities</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide accurate contact and payment information.</li>
          <li>Keep your login secure and do not share passwords.</li>
          <li>Keep receipts for any manual payments (e.g., Paybill).</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>Disputes & Liability</h3>
        <p>KSFP acts as the platform. Schools and payment providers are responsible for issuing final receipts. If there's a dispute about a payment, contact the school and provide your receipt; we will assist where appropriate.</p>
